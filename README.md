## 1. Introduction
About a decade ago, we were students at Kyoto University, immersed in the stunning beauty of Kyoto.
Our love for this city runs deep, and we would like players to experience its charm and visit its streets.
So, we made a game to show how great Kyoto is and teach about Kyoto and Japan using a map of this amazing city.

## 2. How the game progresses
### 2-1. Rules

- To win the game, the ultimate goal is to reach Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion) and defeat the monk in a match.
- To engage in a battle with the monk, a character must reach level 3.
- Reaching level 3 requires accumulating Kyoto Experience Points (KEP) of 6.
- If a character's HP drops below 0, it's game over.

### 2-2. Characters

- Characters possess a name, current location, HP, Kyoto Experience Points (KEP), and Level.
- HP starts at 5, and KEP starts at 0.

### 2-3. Map

- Characters move across a 10 x 10 map.
- Initially, characters are at Kyoto Station.
- Players choose a direction (north, south, east, west) for their character to move.

### 2-4. Special Location

- Certain points on the map are designated as Special Locations.
- At these locations, characters can enjoy delicious local food.
- Consuming food raises HP by 1.

### 2-5. Quizzes

- Upon each character movement, there is a chance for a quiz related to Japan or Kyoto to be presented.
- Correct answers to quizzes increase KEP by 1.
- Incorrect answers result in a decrease of HP by 1.

### 2-6. Battle with the monk

- Once the character reaches level 3 and arrives at Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion), the monk challenges them to a match.
- Winning the battle against the monk leads to game completion.
- Losing the battle against the monk results in a decrease of 2 HP.
- Characters can move to a different location and challenge the monk again at Kinkakuji, allowing multiple attempts.
